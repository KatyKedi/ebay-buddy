# EBAY Buddy

## Description

This application is a tool designed for Ebay sellers to make the process smoother and easier for every sale. It allows the user to create their own account, which will have all of their database details accessible to them. They can edit the database through a simple user-friendly interface that minimalizes complications in navigating the site. This application was inspired by my mom, who runs an Ebay business and yearned for app she could download on her phone to solve issues of organization and documentation of hundreds of items she has for sale.

* Search items by item name
